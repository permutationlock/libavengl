# libaven: a tiny portable C library and build system

I love programming in C, but I always need slices, optionals, and
result types (a.k.a. "errors as values").
The `aven.h` header contains unintrusive definitions for these types.
It also defines a debugger friendly `assert` macro and bounds checked slice
access macros.

The library has expanded to include:

 - slices, optionals, and results: `aven.h`
 - arena allocation: `aven/arena.h` ([inspired by this post][2])
 - command line argument parsing: `aven/arg.h`
 - a C build system: `aven/build.h`, `aven/build/common.h`
 - portable file system interaction: `aven/fs.h`
 - a tiny SIMD linear algebra library: `aven/glm.h`
 - portable file path string manipulation: `aven/path.h`
 - portable process execution and management: `aven/proc.h`
 - slice based strings: `aven/str.h`
 - a bare-bones test framework: `aven/test.h`
 - portable high precision timing: `aven/time.h`
 - portable directory watching (Windows + Linux only): `aven/watch.h`

Everything is cross-platform for Linux and Windows. Many things will work
on non-Linux POSIX systems, but not all[^1].

## Minimizing namespace polution

All identifiers for functions, variables, and macros are snake case
and begin with a prefix for the corresponding header path, except for the
core defined in `aven.h`. E.g. the alloc function defined in `aven/arena.h` is
`aven_arena_alloc`.

When built as a separate translation unit using the build system (see below),
the headers will only include the following C standard headers:
`stddef.h`, `stdbool.h`, `stdint.h`, and `stdassert.h`.
If compiling for C11 then `stdalign.h` and `stdnoreturn.h` are also included.
If using the standalone `aven/time.h` portable timing header, then the libc
`time.h` is included for `timespec` support.

When used as a header only library via the `AVEN_IMPLEMENTATION` macro,
a small number of other C standard library headers will be included.
For Windows targets a few C runtime headers are included (e.g. `io.h`), but
bespoke declarations are used in lieu of the massive unmanageable Win32
headers[^3].
For Linux targets, some files require POSIX features to be enabled
( `_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L`), and a few POSIX specific headers will be
included. Linux
specific features are used where necessary, e.g. `sys/inotify.h` for directory
watching and `/proc/self/exe` for exe path discovery; such functions simply
return errors on non-Linux POSIX targets.

## Aven C build system

The most prominent part of the library is the build system. I've long been
frustrated by the poor portability of Makefiles and the complications of
depending on a larger build system like CMake. I wanted a build system
that satisfies the following requirements:

 - it should depend only on the existence of a C compiler (`cc`), a linker
   (`cc` or a separate `ld`), and (maybe) an archiver (`ar`);
 - it should include a portable API to interact with the filesystem
   (`mkdir`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `touch`) wihtout relying on external binaries[^2];
 - builds should be directed graphs of steps and dependencies between steps;
 - the user must be able to specify exactly what executables and flags will
   be used for each build tool, e.g. how the variables `CC` and `CFLAGS` are
   used in Makefiles;
 - there must by a standard easy way for a parent project to build and use
   artifacts from a dependency project.

The following toochains are fully supported, e.g. the default configuration
should work out-of-the-box when one is used to compile the `build.c`. 

 - GNU (Linux + Windows w/[MinGW][3]): -cc `gcc` -ar `ar`
 - clang (Linux + Windows w/MSVC or MinGW): -cc `clang` -ar `llvm-ar`
 - MSVC (Windows): -cc `cl.exe` -ld `link.ex` -ar `lib.exe`
 - [tinycc][5] (Linux + Windows): -cc `tcc` -ccflags
   "-D\_\_BIGGEST\_ALIGNMENT\_\_=16" -ar `tcc` -arflags "-ar -rcs"

The following toolchains are undectectable from predefined macros, but have
been tested with the indicated configuration.

 - [Zig][1] (Linux + Windows): -cc `zig` -ccflags "cc" -ldflags "cc" -ar `zig`
   -arflags "ar -rcs"
 - [cproc][4] w/GNU (Linux): -cc `cproc` -ccflags "-std=c11" -ar `ar`

Hopefully many other toolchains are supported as well! The MSVC
toolchain is so weird that the build configuration has been expanded to be
very accommodating.

### Cross-compilation

Since the build system is simple and flexible, cross compilation is achievable
regardless of the host or toolchain. Below we build the build system on a
host `x86_64` Linux machine with TinyCC, then create build artifacts for
an `x86_64` Windows target using MinGW-w64.

```
tcc -D__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__=16 -o build build.c
./build -cc "x86_64-w64-mingww32-gcc" -ar "x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar" \
    -ccflags "-O2 -Werror -Wall -Wextra" -exext ".exe" -soext ".dll"
```

## Building the library

A static object file can built using the contained build system.  

### Building the build system

On Linux systems you can compile the build system with `make`.

```shell
make
```

You can also simply compile it manually with your favorite C compiler,
e.g. using `gcc`

```shell
gcc -o build build.c
```

or [tinycc][5]

```shell
tcc -D__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__=16 -o build build.c
```

or MSVC on Windows.

```shell
cl.exe /std:c11 /Fe:build.exe build.c
```

### Showing the build system help message

```shell
./build help
```

### Building the library

```shell
./build
```

### Running the tests

```shell
./build test
```

### Cleaning up the build artifacts

```shell
./build clean
```

[^1]: Some things like file system notifications and detecting the path to a
    running executable are not standard across
    POSIX systems. Currently everything in `aven/watch.h` and the
    `aven_path_exe` function are implemented
    for Windows and Linux only.

[^2]: If you have ever tried to write a `make clean` step that works
    on both Linux and Windows, then you know my motivation here :(

[^3]: I like to know what is in my C namespace. I am a [musl][6]
      man and can easliy read through the simple libc and Linux headers.
      Windows Win32 API on the other hand has massive "inaccessible" headers,
      but good documentation and little variation accross architecture.
      Thus is simply nicer to write the definitions myself.
